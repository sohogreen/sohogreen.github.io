## About

Soho Green champions St Anneâ€™s Churchyard in Soho. The charity worked with Westminster City Council to transform the public open space from a no-go area in the 1990s to the haven it is now. Soho Green created The Wall of Light, the Art Loo and the Big Table. But most of all the charity delivered a safe, clean open space for all of Soho to enjoy.
