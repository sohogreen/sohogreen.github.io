## About

Soho Green champions St Anne's Churchyard in Soho. The charity worked with Westminster City Council to transform the space from a no-go area to the haven it is now. Soho Green created The Wall of Light, the Art Loo and the Big Table. But most of all the charity inspired and part funded a safe, clean open space for all of Soho to enjoy. See the slide shows below to find out more.
